# Comparative Study of Diffusion-Based vs Inception-Based Neural Speech Decoders

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of **DiffusionUNet** (a diffusion-based neural speech decoder) compared against the **NeuroIncept Decoder** (an inception-based baseline).  
The project focuses on reconstructing **log-Mel spectrograms** from **stereotactic EEG (sEEG)** signals, contributing to research in **speech neuroprosthetics** and **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)**.

## ðŸ“– Abstract
We present a comparative study between two neural architectures for EEG-to-speech decoding:
- **NeuroIncept Decoder** â†’ CNN + GRU hybrid using Inception modules.  
- **DiffusionUNet** â†’ A novel U-Netâ€“like denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).  

Results show that **DiffusionUNet** outperforms the baseline in terms of **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)**, while maintaining competitive performance on the **Spectro-Temporal Glimpsing Index (STGI)**.

## ðŸ§© Methodology
### Dataset
We use the **SingleWordProductionDutch-iBIDS** dataset [Verwoert et al., 2022], consisting of paired sEEG and speech recordings from 10 Dutch-speaking participants.  
- EEG sampled at **1024/2048 Hz** â†’ downsampled to **1024 Hz**.  
- Speech audio at **48 kHz** â†’ downsampled to **16 kHz**.  
- Ground truth represented as **log-Mel spectrograms** (128 bins).  

### Preprocessing
- **EEG:** Bandpass filtering (70â€“170 Hz), notch filtering (50/100/150 Hz), Hilbert transform, windowing (50 ms, 10 ms shift), z-score normalization.  
- **Audio:** Log-Mel spectrogram extraction (LibROSA).  

### Models
- **NeuroIncept Decoder:** Inception-style CNNs + GRU layers.  
- **DiffusionUNet:** DDPM-based conditional generative model with dilated 1D Conv U-Net.  

### Training
- Optimizer: **Adam (lr=1e-4)**  
- Batch size: **128**  
- Early stopping with patience = 5  
- Subject-specific training with **80/20 train-test split**  

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** â€“ reconstruction error  
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)** â€“ signal fidelity  
- **Spectro-Temporal Glimpsing Index (STGI)** â€“ perceptual intelligibility

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Model            | MSE â†“       | PCC â†‘       | STGI â†‘     |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **DiffusionUNet** | **0.458 Â± 0.085** | **0.928 Â± 0.014** | 0.512 Â± 0.014 |
| NeuroIncept      | 0.618 Â± 0.141 | 0.901 Â± 0.023 | **0.521 Â± 0.021** |

- DiffusionUNet achieves **better accuracy and stronger correlation** with ground truth.  
- NeuroIncept has a slight advantage in STGI.  
- Visual comparisons confirm **DiffusionUNet produces spectrograms closer to the original**.
